algorithms + web app code gen
==========

## This project contains:

* Large collection of (mostly) well known algorithms and well known programming interview questions ('alg' package)
* Code generation / scaffolding helpers for various web frameworks, to provide additional layout/complex type support/basic workflow for typical CRUD applications ('gen' package)

At the moment, code generation is only implemented for Rails.
