     * Questions it should be able to answer quickly:
     *
     * All documents containing word X
     * All documents containing words X,Y,Z
     * Need information on where the words occur in the document
     * Need to take into account how much of an authority a page appears to be (either using PageRank or something else)
     *
     * Other issues: how to allow for updating/searching index at the same time?
     * How to distribute index over multiple machines?
